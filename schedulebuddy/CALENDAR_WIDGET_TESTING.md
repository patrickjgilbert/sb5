## How to Test

### 1. Start the Development Server
```bash
cd /Users/patrickgilbert/Desktop/sb3/schedulebuddy
npm run dev
```

### 2. Create a Test Event
1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Click "Create New Event"
3. Fill out the form with:
   - Event Name: "Test Calendar Widget"
   - Description: "Testing the new calendar functionality"
   - Start Date: Today's date
   - End Date: 30 days from today
4. Click "Create Event"

### 3. Add Test Participants
1. From the admin dashboard, copy the participant URL
2. Open the participant form in new tabs/windows
3. Submit 2-3 responses with different availability patterns:

**Response 1 (Alex):**
```
I'm available weekday evenings after 6 PM and weekend mornings. 
Not available July 15-20 due to vacation.
```

**Response 2 (Sarah):**
```
Weekends work best for me, especially Saturday afternoons. 
Weekday evenings after 7 PM are also good when kids are in bed.
```

**Response 3 (Mike):**
```
I'm flexible most days. Mornings work great due to time zone differences. 
Friday afternoons are usually busy with team meetings.
```

### 4. Generate AI Analysis
1. Click "Generate Meeting Suggestions" 
2. Wait for the analysis to complete
3. The calendar widget should appear below the AI suggestions

### 5. Test Calendar Features

#### Visual Testing
- Verify dates show different colors based on availability
- Check that suggested meeting dates have purple borders
- Confirm today's date has a blue indicator
- Look for availability dots on dates with time slots

#### Interaction Testing
- **Desktop**: Hover over dates and verify hover states
- **Mobile**: Tap dates to toggle selection
- **Navigation**: Use arrow buttons to navigate months
- **Selection**: Click dates to see detailed availability panels

#### Data Verification
- Selected dates should show participant-specific information
- Time slots should display confidence levels
- Availability percentages should be calculated correctly
- Participant names should appear for available slots

## API Integration

### Enhanced Analysis Endpoint
The `/api/analyze` route now returns:
```typescript
{
  suggestions: Array<{date, time, confidence, notes}>, // Original 3 suggestions
  dailyAvailability: Array<{
    date: string,
    slots: Array<{
      time: string,
      confidence: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low',
      availableParticipants: string[],
      totalParticipants: number
    }>,
    hasFullAvailability: boolean,
    availabilityPercentage: number
  }>,
  // ... other existing fields
}
```

## Technical Implementation

### Components Added
- `src/app/admin/[eventId]/components/CalendarWidget.tsx` - Main calendar component
- Enhanced analysis interfaces in admin page
- Updated API route with daily availability generation

### Dependencies Used
- `date-fns` - Date manipulation and formatting (already installed)
- Tailwind CSS - Styling and responsive design
- React hooks - State management and effects

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
1. Availability analysis uses keyword matching simulation (for demo)
2. Time slots are predefined common times
3. Random factor added for demonstration purposes

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Real AI Analysis**: Integrate with OpenAI for more sophisticated availability parsing
2. **Custom Time Slots**: Allow users to define specific time ranges
3. **Time Zone Support**: Handle multiple time zones automatically
4. **Export Features**: Export calendar view or selected times
5. **Participant Filtering**: Filter calendar by specific participants
6. **Conflict Detection**: Highlight scheduling conflicts more clearly
